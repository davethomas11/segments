In this episode, Renota Scheopp, joins me as a special guest. We speak about her experience being involved with the Nook e-reader where they forked the Android Open Source Project. From there we delve into topics like women in tech, mental illness, and the embedded developer vs. the desktop developer mindset in Android.
