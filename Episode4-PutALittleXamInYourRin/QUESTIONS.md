You’ve shared with me a mobile application you built for Android and iOS using Xamarin for your meetups. It was very cool seeing how much code you can share between the two, and seeing how integrated Xamarin is with both platforms SDKs. How did you get started with Xamarin?

Do you have to use a mac to compile for iOS?

In Xamarin are the UI elements native platform elements or are they provided by different C# based framework?

What are some cool libraries/frameworks to use with Xamarin to ease development? Tell me about them?
